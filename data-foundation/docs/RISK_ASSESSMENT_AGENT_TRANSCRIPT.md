Provide a structured analysis including:
1. Overall trend direction (increasing/decreasing/stable)
2. Monthly rate of change (percentage)
3. Seasonal patterns or anomalies
4. Key observations about consumption patterns
 
Format your response with quantified metrics where possible.
Focus on trends that could impact annual goal achievement.

Based on the trend analysis below, assess the risk of missing the annual electricity goal:
 
Trend Summary: {"analysis": {"overall_trend_direction": "increasing", "monthly_rate_of_change": {"2025-05": "-5.56%", "2025-06": "5.89%", "2025-07": "5.66%", "2025-08": "7.14%"}, "seasonal_patterns_or_anomalies": {"pattern": "Electricity consumption increases during the summer months (June to August).", "anomalies": "None"}, "key_observations": {"consumption_patterns": "Electricity consumption has been steadily increasing over the 6-month period. The highest increase was observed in August 2025, with a 7.14% increase from the previous month. This could be due to increased use of air conditioning systems during the summer months.", "cost_patterns": "Despite the increase in consumption, the cost has been decreasing. This could be due to a decrease in electricity rates during these months.", "emission_patterns": "CO2e emissions have been increasing in line with the increase in electricity consumption. This could impact the site's annual emissions goals if the trend continues."}}, "overall_trend": "unknown", "monthly_change_rate": 0.0, "confidence_level": 0.5}
Annual Goal: 15.0 tonnes CO2e
Current Performance: 8.05958 tonnes CO2e (9 months)
Baseline Consumption: 1.570125 tonnes CO2e
Months Remaining: 3
 
Calculate the projected annual performance and assign a risk level:
 
Risk Levels:
- LOW: >90% chance of meeting goal (projected performance within 10% of goal)
- MEDIUM: 50-90% chance of meeting goal (projected performance 10-25% from goal)
- HIGH: 10-50% chance of meeting goal (projected performance 25-50% from goal)
- CRITICAL: <10% chance of meeting goal (projected performance >50% from goal)
 
Provide:
1. Projected annual consumption based on current trend
2. Gap analysis (difference from goal in absolute terms and percentage)
3. Risk level assignment with justification
4. Key risk factors considering baseline vs current performance
5. Assessment of whether goal is achievable given current trend
 
Note: For CO2e targets, consider that the goal is typically a reduction target (e.g., -10% from baseline).
For percentage-based goals like "-10%", calculate the target as: baseline * (1 + goal_percentage/100).
