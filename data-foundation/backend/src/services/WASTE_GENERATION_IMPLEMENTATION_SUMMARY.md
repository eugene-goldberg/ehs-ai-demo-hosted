# Waste Generation Retrieval Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented waste generation data retrieval functionality in the ContextRetriever class to handle WASTE_GENERATION intents for Algonquin IL and Houston TX facilities only.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Analysis
- Examined Neo4j database structure for waste generation data
- Found WasteGeneration nodes with the following structure:
  - Site IDs: algonquin_il and houston_tx 
  - Properties: date, amount_pounds, disposal_cost_usd, waste_type, disposal_method, contractor, recycling_rate_achieved, recycling_target, performance_notes
  - 104 records each for both supported sites

### 2. Method Implementation
Added get_waste_context() method to ContextRetriever class with:
- Site name mapping for user-friendly input
- Strict filtering to only allow Algonquin IL and Houston TX
- Support for date range filtering (start_date, end_date)
- Comprehensive data aggregation including:
  - Total waste amounts and costs
  - Waste type breakdowns
  - Recycling rate calculations
  - Recent data samples

### 3. Intent Integration
Updated get_context_for_intent() function to handle waste_generation intent type.

### 4. Data Validation
Current data shows:
- Algonquin IL: 104 records, 4 waste types (Organic, Hazardous, Recyclable, Non_Hazardous)
- Houston TX: 104 records, same 4 waste types
- Date range: March 2025 to August 2025
- Total processing: ~123,000 pounds of waste across both sites

## Security & Restrictions
- CRITICAL: Only supports Algonquin IL and Houston TX facilities
- Returns explicit error message for unsupported sites
- Follows same security patterns as electricity and water retrieval

## Testing
Comprehensive test suite created (test_waste_context.py) covering:
- Basic retrieval for both supported sites
- Site name mapping (houston, houston_tx, algonquin, etc.)
- Date range filtering
- Unsupported site rejection
- Intent function integration
- Data structure validation

All tests PASSED with 100% success rate.

## File Changes
- Modified: /home/azureuser/dev/ehs-ai-demo/data-foundation/backend/src/services/context_retriever.py
  - Added get_waste_context() method (lines 323-435)
  - Updated get_context_for_intent() function to handle waste_generation intent
- Created: Test files and documentation

## Status: COMPLETE
Waste generation retrieval is now fully functional for Algonquin IL and Houston TX facilities with comprehensive testing and validation.
